# Conclusion

The FracMinHash and min-set-cov approaches explored here provide
powerful and accurate techniques for analyzing metagenomes, with well
defined limitations. We show several immediate applications for both taxonomic and mapping-based analysis of metagenomes. We provide
an implementation of these approaches in robust
open-source software, together with workflows to enable their
practical use on large data sets.  The approaches also offer many
opportunities for further exploration and improvement with different
data structures, alternative approximation algorithms, and additional
summarization approaches.
