# Conclusion

The _Scaled MinHash_ and min-set-cov approaches explored here are
powerful and accurate approaches to analyzing metagenomes, with well
defined limitations. The immediate applications for both mapping-based
and taxonomic analysis of metagnomes are already interesting. In
particular, we provide implementations of these approaches in robust
open-source software, together with workflows to enable their
practical use on large data sets.  The approaches also offer many
opportunities for further exploration and improvement with additional
sketch types, additional approximation algorithms, and additional
summarization approaches. The world is our oyster!
