# Conclusion

_Scaled MinHash_ sketches are simple to implement and analyze, with
consistent guarantees for the range of values and subsetting
properties when applied to datasets.  Containment and similarity
operations between _Scaled MinHash_ sketches avoid the need to access
the original data or more limited representations that only allow
membership query, and serve as a proxy for large scale comparisons
between hundreds or thousands of datasets.

Small genomes require low scaled values in order to properly estimate
containment and similarity, and exact $k$-mer matching is brittle when
considering evolutionarily-diverged organisms.  While some of these
problems can be overcome in future work, _Scaled MinHash_ sketches can
serve as a prefilter for more accurate and computationally expensive
applications, allowing these methods to be used in larger scales by
avoiding processing data that is unlikely to return usable results.

_Scaled MinHash_ sketches are effective basic building blocks for
creating a software ecosystem that allow practical applications,
including taxonomic classification in metagenomes and large scale
indexing and searching in public genomic databases.
