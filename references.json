    "abstract": "The Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB; https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org) provides a phylogenetically consistent and rank normalized genome-based taxonomy for prokaryotic genomes sourced from the NCBI Assembly database. GTDB R06-RS202 spans 254 090 bacterial and 4316 archaeal genomes, a 270% increase since the introduction of the GTDB in November, 2017. These genomes are organized into 45 555 bacterial and 2339 archaeal species clusters which is a 200% increase since the integration of species clusters into the GTDB in June, 2019. Here, we explore prokaryotic diversity from the perspective of the GTDB and highlight the importance of metagenome-assembled genomes in expanding available genomic representation. We also discuss improvements to the GTDB website which allow tracking of taxonomic changes, easy assessment of genome assembly quality, and identification of genomes assembled from type material or used as species representatives. Methodological updates and policy changes made since the inception of the GTDB are then described along with the procedure used to update species clusters in the GTDB. We conclude with a discussion on the use of average nucleotide identities as a pragmatic approach for delineating prokaryotic species.",

    "abstract": "Taxonomy of plant pathogenic bacteria is challenging because pathogens of different crops often belong to the same named species but current taxonomy does not provide names for bacteria below the subspecies level. The introduction of the host range-based pathovar system in the 1980s provided a temporary solution to this problem but has many limitations. The affordability of genome sequencing now provides the opportunity for developing a new genome-based taxonomic framework. We already proposed to name individual bacterial isolates based on pairwise genome similarity. Here, we expand on this idea and propose to use genome similarity-based codes, which we now call life identification numbers (LINs), to describe and name bacterial taxa. Using 93 genomes of Pseudomonas syringae sensu lato, LINs were compared with a P. syringae genome tree whereby the assigned LINs were found to be informative of a majority of phylogenetic relationships. LINs also reflected host range and outbreak association for strains of P. syringae pathovar actinidiae, a pathovar for which many genome sequences are available. We conclude that LINs could provide the basis for a new taxonomic framework to address the shortcomings of the current pathovar system and to complement the current taxonomic system of bacteria in general.",

    "abstract": "We evaluate the performance of three metagenome assemblers, IDBA, MetaSPAdes, and MEGAHIT, on short-read sequencing of a defined “mock” community containing 64 genomes (Shakya et al. (2013)). We update the reference metagenome for this mock community and detect several additional genomes in the read data set. We show that strain confusion results in significant loss in assembly of reference genomes that are otherwise completely present in the read data set. In agreement with previous studies, we find that MEGAHIT performs best computationally; we also show that MEGAHIT tends to recover larger portions of the strain variants than the other assemblers.",

    "abstract": "Min hash is a probabilistic method for estimating the similarity of two sets in terms of their Jaccard index, defined as the ration of the size of their intersection to their union. We demonstrate that this method performs best when the sets under consideration are of similar size and the performance degrades considerably when the sets are of very different size. We introduce a new and efficient approach, called the approach, that is more suitable for estimating the Jaccard index of sets of very different size. We accomplish this by leveraging another probabilistic method (in particular, Bloom filters) for fast membership queries. We derive bounds on the probability of estimate errors for the containment min hash approach and show it significantly improves upon the classical min hash approach. We also show significant improvements in terms of time and space complexity. As an application, we use this method to detect the presence/absence of organisms in a metagenomic data set, showing that it can detect the presence of very small, low abundance microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "Culture-independent analyses of microbial communities have progressed dramatically in the last decade, particularly due to advances in methods for biological profiling via shotgun metagenomics. Opportunities for improvement continue to accelerate, with greater access to multi-omics, microbial reference genomes, and strain-level diversity. To leverage these, we present bioBakery 3, a set of integrated, improved methods for taxonomic, strain-level, functional, and phylogenetic profiling of metagenomes newly developed to build on the largest set of reference sequences now available. Compared to current alternatives, MetaPhlAn 3 increases the accuracy of taxonomic profiling, and HUMAnN 3 improves that of functional potential and activity. These methods detected novel disease-microbiome links in applications to CRC (1262 metagenomes) and IBD (1635 metagenomes and 817 metatranscriptomes). Strain-level profiling of an additional 4077 metagenomes with StrainPhlAn 3 and PanPhlAn 3 unraveled the phylogenetic and functional structure of the common gut microbe , previously described by only 15 isolate genomes. With open-source implementations and cloud-deployable reproducible workflows, the bioBakery 3 platform can help researchers deepen the resolution, scale, and accuracy of multi-omic profiling for microbial community studies.",
